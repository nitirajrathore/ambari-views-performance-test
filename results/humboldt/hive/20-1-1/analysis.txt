all the failures are because of error between some proxy and ambari-server.
Ambari server sends the data but proxy does not treats it as legal and reports error to the jmeter
there were no errors in the ambari server logs.
all the jobs successed from ambari side
all the jobs succeeded in yarn cluster. (checked from yarn ui)
